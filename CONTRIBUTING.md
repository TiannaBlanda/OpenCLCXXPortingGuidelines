# Contributing to the Porting Guidelines

We hope the Porting Guidelines will be a constantly evolving document, and that's why
all comments, suggestions for improvements, and contributions are most welcome.

All pull requests should be done against the `develop` branch. The editors review all
changes and periodically increments the version date in the introduction. 
There are no explicit style guidelines, however, it is recommended to follow current
style of the document.
